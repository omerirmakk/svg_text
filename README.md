For What?

If you wanna make a good looking portfolio website (or anything you want)
You should consider about this Svg background style

How to use:

Change the background color however you want from index.js;

const colors = ["####", "####", "####"];

then change the font (as you wish) from GlobalCSS;

.filled-heading {
text-transform: uppercase;
font-family: "#######";
font-size: ##;
line-height: ##;
}
